#Model Binding & Input Validations

This project is used to demonstrate my proficiency with model binding and input validations in Asp.Net core.

I covered basic attributes such as FromHeader, FromRoute, FromBody, FromHeader... among others

I covered techniques such as Model validation, custom validation, IValidatableObject, Bind&BindNever, 

I created Custom Model binders to be used in scenarios where out of the box binders may not suffice. I also touched on Model binder providers, which basically involves adding a custom model binder as a service to be used globally in large applications.
